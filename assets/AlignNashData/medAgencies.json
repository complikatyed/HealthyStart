      "description":"Health Assist Tennessee is a statewide nonprofit that helps adults and children in Tennessee get the healthcare they need whether it is by connecting them with a state-sponsored insurance plan like TennCare or one of the Cover Tennessee plans, or if they are not eligible for those insurance programs, we offer referrals to community resources like sliding scale clinics, prescription assistance plans or discounted medical equipment suppliers. Our Children's program helps ensure that children in state custody receive the services that the Department of Children's Services has recommended for that child under TennCare. We have 60 employees who collectively speak 13 languages. In 2008 we helped over 50,000 people through one-on-one interactions with our counselors on the telephone, through educational workshops and presentations or through medical interpreting and cultural competency trainings."
