          <h4 class="describe">Staying in School</h4>

          <p>The fact that you're having a baby doesn't mean you have to drop out
             of school.  There are resources available to help you keep up
             with school during your pregnancy.  Others, including schools with
             alternative schedules, and childcare vouchers from the state, are
             designed to help you get back to school once the baby is born.  The list below will help you get started with plans to continue your education. </p>
