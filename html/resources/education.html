<h2>Staying in School</h2>

<p>The fact that you're having a baby doesn't mean you have to drop out of school.  There are many resources available to help you keep up with school during your pregnancy.  Others, including schools with alternative schedules, and childcare vouchers from the state, are designed to help you get back to school once the baby is born.  The list below will help you get started with plans to continue your education. </p>
